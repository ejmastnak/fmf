A collection of my math and physics-related notes, reports and study guides from the physics program at the Faculty of Math and Physics (*Fakulteta za matematiko in fiziko* (FMF) in Slovene) at the University of Ljubljana in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 

Although the exact course material is specific to the University of Ljubljana, the content in this repository is fairly standard for an undergraduate physics program, and I am making the notes publically available in the hope that they might be useful to others learning similar material.

Note: All the documents are equipped with "clickable" hyperlinks in the table of contents for easier document navigation, but you must download the pdf files for this to work—the hyperlinks don't work on GitHub's online pdf viewer. 

Obligatory disclaimer: Mistakes—both trivial typos and and legitimate errors—are likely. Keep in mind that these are the notes of an undergraduate student in the process of learning the material himself, so take what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling me, by Github pull request, email or some other means, I’ll be happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of errors.
