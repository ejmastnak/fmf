# This repository has a new home

TLDR: You can find all the notes previously held in this repository at [https://ejmastnak.github.io/fmf.html](https://ejmastnak.github.io/fmf.html) 

### What happened
This repository originally held the `tex` source code and associated `pdf` files for my undergraduate physics notes from the physics program at the Faculty of Math and Physics (FMF) at the University of Ljublana.

Some FMF professors have published textbooks covering material similar to the lectures on which I based my notes, and a few faculty members felt that I was compromising the integrity and authorship rights of such textbooks by publishing the LaTeX source code of my own lecture notes on GitHub. That is understandable, and we reached an amicable mutual agreement that I publish only `pdf` documents, and somewhat update the licensing terms, of notes that cover content similar to existing FMF textbooks.

Instead of completely reworking this GitHub repository, which wouldn't make sense anyway if I were including only `pdf` files and not source code, I used this as an opportunity to get around to creating a proper website to host my lecture notes. And this is how [https://ejmastnak.github.io/fmf.html](https://ejmastnak.github.io/fmf.html) came to be.

Since there are still legacy documents floating around in cyberspace that link to [https://github.com/ejmastnak/fmf](https://github.com/ejmastnak/fmf), I have left this `README` here to redirect visitors and avoid broken links from old documents.
